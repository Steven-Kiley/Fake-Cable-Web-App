# Fake-Cable-Web-App

This is a web project that I completed as part of an Enterprise Development class. The language is Java J2EE and the webserver used 
was Apache Tomcat 7. Running this project would require configuring it within an Apache Tomcat server. The web.xml file is included
if that's something you'd like to do. There are two PDF files located at the second level of the file structure that are walkthroughs 
of the program if you'd prefer to see the functionality in that manner. If you choose to run the application for yourself then please
refer to the ReadMe PDF file.

The purpose of the application is to mimic the functionality of a cable company website. Customers, technicians, customer service representatives, and managers are able to log in and are met with the appropriate portal. Additionally, they are each only allowed to 
access webpages that are part of their "role" and restricted from accessing the rest.

All HTML is dynamically generated and all changes are saved to serialized files. Interfacing with a relational database would have better
represented actual business practices, but for demonstration purposes I stored data in serialized files. 

Thanks,
Steven Kiley
